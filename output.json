       "review": "Avengers: Age Of Ultron is the squeal to the avengers(2012). Age Of Ultron is about when Tony Stark tries to make a robot called Ultron. It's meant to save the world but things go wrong and now they have to get every avenger and more people to stop Ultron. First off, Age Of Ultron was amazing and blew the first avengers out of the water. Everything was more fun, and raised the stakes to a whole another level. Now, there are some parts of the movie that felt not needed for this movie but you know that it will become a bigger piece in the MCU. What makes age of Ultron great as the first one is seeing all the avengers together. The old cast is great as before and with the addition of the new characters, it's just better. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great additions to the MCU. The one person who stole the whole movie was Hawkeye. He had a lot more screen time and much more character development. Overall Avengers: Age Of Ultron was an amazing movie, much smarter and fun than any other marvel movie yet. A must watch In the theaters. Great start to the summer movies of 2015. "
